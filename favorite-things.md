Here are some of my favorite things:
- [Inherent Vice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherent_vice_(library_and_archival_science)): the tendency in physical objects to deteriorate because of the fundamental instability of the components of which they are made, as opposed to deterioration caused by external forces. All objects have some kind of inherent vice as a result of the baseline law of entropy.
- [Null Morpheme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_morpheme): a morpheme that has no phonetic form
